Python project


Hi! Welcome to my Python project for Compsys 302.

How to run the application on ubuntu linux:

Since IP is already configured dynamically, all you need to do is run the server and copy the IP address that comes up in the console. EG "202.29.43.24:8000" into your web browser.

Example people that this work with:

Person1:

Username - jyao413
Password - tigerj2_590856141
Password2 - qwe

Person2:

Username - mmir415
Password - mmir415_339816700
Password2 - 3302

Person3:

Username - jall229
Password - jacoballen4534_205023320
Password2 - key


1. You will be greeted with a login button. Press that to go to the login page

2. Login with your UPI as your username

3. Login with your githubUSERNAME_UniversityID in the form "tigerj2_590856141".

4. Login with your second password that is meant for decryption of private data

(OPTIONAL STEP)5. If you require a new private key and private data, click the check box and you will be given a new one for the password2 you have entered.

6. When you are logged in, you will be greeted with a navbar and the online users, broadcasts to view and broadcast filter.

FILTER: To use this filter, enter a name and submit. If the system finds any matching broadcasts, it will display them

Sending a public broadcast: To send a broadcast, click "public broadcast". You will be taken to a page which allows you to type what you want to send. 
Type your message and submit to send the broadcast. If the broadcast is successful, you will be greeted with a page that will allow you to return to the menu.

Sending a private message: To send a private message, click "private message". You will be taken to a page where you should enter the username of someone that is online (If they aren't online, you will receieve an error message that will redirect you). 
You will be taken to an interface where you can view all messages you've sent and received from the other user, granted that your private/public key pair has not changed since your last session.

Blocking a user: To block a user, click "Block users" and type in a name to block. If the block was successful, you will be redirected to the main page and their broadcasts will no longer be visible to you. 

Changing your status to away: To change your status to "away", click "Away" on the nav bar. The next time the client reports your status, you will be away.

Changing your status to online: To change your status to "online", click "online" on the nav bar. The next time the client reports your status, you will be online. You will also be reported online by default if you haven't changed your status. 

Changing your status to offline: To change your status to "offline", click "Signout" on the nav bar. The client will immediately report your status as offline.

Checking for new messages: The client will automatically change innerHTML code so you won't need to do anything to receive new messages other than look at your message boxes!
